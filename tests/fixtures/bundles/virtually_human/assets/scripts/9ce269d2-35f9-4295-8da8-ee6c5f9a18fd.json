Don't change anything but the number itself.\n// Larger numbers speed up the animation, smaller numbers slow it down.\n// Negative numbers reverse the direction of the slide.\n\nfloat Rate = 0.2;\n\n// If you want to change anything else, you will need to change the script itself.\n\n// Only one texture animation script can be run on a prim at one time.\n// Currently, texture animations will over-ride your texture Scale.\n// Texture animations are client-side.\n\n//***********************************************************************************\n\n// TO CHANGE TO A STEPPED ANIMATION INSTEAD OF SMOOTH\n\n//     Remove the SMOOTH flag, along with one of the | characters. \"(ANIM_ON | LOOP,\"\n\n// TO RUN THE ANIMATION ON ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE PRIM\n\n//     Change the ALL_SIDES to the face number of the side you want to animate.\n\n// For anything else, see the LSL WIKI, or ask a friend who knows how to script.\n\n// **********************************************************************************\n// **********************************************************************************\n\ndefault \n{ \n    state_entry() \n    { \n        llSetTextureAnim(ANIM_ON | SMOOTH | LOOP, ALL_SIDES,0,0,0.0, 1,Rate);\n    } \n}\n",
